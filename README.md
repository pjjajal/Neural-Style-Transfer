This repository is contains an implemenation of Neural Style Transfer. 

This is one of my first projects using Tensorflow and I did not spend much time structuring code--forgive my laziness, my newer projects aren't as poorly structured. The notebooks (should) still be useable for generating images. The repository also contains a generated image.
